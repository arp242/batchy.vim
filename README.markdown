Batchy.vim is a little plugin to perform batch operations on files.

The general idea is to keep it as simple as possible; batch operations such as
batch renames are 1) potentially very dangerous if you do it wrong, and 2) not
something people usually do very often.

Run `:Batchy` to display a list of files in the current directory that you can
edit, run `:Batchy` again to convert it to a shell script that you can examine
for correctness, maybe modify, and run with `:%!sh`.

Note: you probably need a fairly new Vim for this; e.g. `readdirex()` was added
in Vim 8.2.0988 (June 2020). This also won't work for Neovim until
[#12525](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/12525) is fixed.


Usage
-----
Sometimes you want to rename a bunch of files, and typing all that `mv` is a lot
of work! For a long time my solution for this was:

    $ ls -1 | vim -
    :%s/.*/\0  \0/ | Tabularize / /

    [ .. do stuff in Vim ..]

    :%s/^/mv /
    :%!sh

I know there are tools for this out there; I tried many and found all of them
confusing. I don't do this often enough to learn the syntax of some tool, it's a
"scary" operation because what if you get it wrong? And I already know Vim so I
can just use that. A bunch of helper functions for this evolved in my vimrc over
the years, and batchy is the end result.

---

When you use `:Batchy` you get a new buffer filled with the contents of the
current directory:

    ftplugin         ‚Üê  ftplugin         ‚îÇ  d  0.0K  Thu 2021-06-17 00:44:20
    plugin           ‚Üê  plugin           ‚îÇ  d  0.0K  Thu 2021-06-17 00:50:21
    LICENSE          ‚Üê  LICENSE          ‚îÇ  f  1.1K  Thu 2021-06-17 00:21:12
    README.markdown  ‚Üê  README.markdown  ‚îÇ  f  2.3K  Thu 2021-06-17 00:45:46

There are three columns, separated by `‚Üê` and `‚îÇ` characters; the first column
is the *destination* filename and the second the *source*: this is the reverse
of most commandline tools, but makes it a lot easier to edit the destination
filenames in Vim with `:s` (more on that later). The left pointing arrow is
there as a reminder that it's the reverse.

Everything after the `‚îÇ` is a comment and lists the file type, size, and
modification date. You can put anything you want there when editing. Note this
is U+2502 ("box drawings light vertical") and not the regular `|` (U+007C,
vertical line).

Now, let's say you modify the buffer to prefix every file with `xx-`:

    xx-ftplugin         ‚Üê  ftplugin         ‚îÇ  d  0.0K  Thu 2021-06-17 00:44:20
    xx-plugin           ‚Üê  plugin           ‚îÇ  d  0.0K  Thu 2021-06-17 00:50:21
    xx-LICENSE          ‚Üê  LICENSE          ‚îÇ  f  1.1K  Thu 2021-06-17 00:21:12
    xx-README.markdown  ‚Üê  README.markdown  ‚îÇ  f  2.3K  Thu 2021-06-17 00:45:46

Run `:Batchy` again and it will replace the buffer with a shell script:

    mv -n 'ftplugin'         'xx-ftplugin'         # d  0.0K  Thu 2021-06-17 00:44:20
    mv -n 'plugin'           'xx-plugin'           # d  0.0K  Thu 2021-06-17 00:51:16
    mv -n 'LICENSE'          'xx-LICENSE'          # f  1.1K  Thu 2021-06-17 00:21:12
    mv -n 'README.markdown'  'xx-README.markdown'  # f  2.5K  Thu 2021-06-17 00:51:06

*Nothing gets run automatically*. Write it to a file or use `:%!sh`.

Whitespace surrounding the `‚Üê` and `‚îÇ` markers is removed; if you want filenames
with spaces (or other special shell characters) then you can just type them
without escaping. For example this:

    the "README" file  ‚Üê  README.markdown  ‚îÇ  f  3.0K  Thu 2021-06-17 01:01:02

Becomes:

    mv -n 'README.markdown'  'the "README" file'  # f  3.0K  Thu 2021-06-17 01:01:02

You can't have a file with leading or trailing whitespace, and there is no way
to escape the `‚Üê` and `‚îÇ` marker; they're chosen because it's extremely unlikely
that you want to put those in a filename. If you want either of those things
then, well, tough üôÉ

Batchy command
---------------
On the first `:Batchy` invocation it will create a new `batchy` buffer:

- Any arguments will be run as commands before we do anything, this is used to
  create a new buffer and maybe set some options for this if you want. This
  defaults to `g:batchy_new`; the default is:

      tabnew | setl noswapfile buftype=nofile bufhidden=hide nowrap

  For example, to re-use the current buffer without setting anything:

      :Batchy echo

  The `echo` just functions as a no-op here to prevent batchy from using the
  default. It's a bit of a hack üòÖ

  Note that the defaults are overwritten, so if you want to keep that `setl`
  you'll need to add it again (or create a wrapper command). I have a little
  `:S` command, which is useful in general:

      " Convert buffer to and from scratch.
      command! S
          \  if &buftype is# 'nofile' | setl swapfile buftype= bufhidden=
          \| else                     | setl noswapfile buftype=nofile bufhidden=hide | endif
          \| echo printf('swapfile=%s buftype=%s bufhidden=%s', &swapfile, &buftype, &bufhidden)

  You can create a convenient shell alias with:

      alias batchy='vim +":Batchy echo" +"setl noswapfile buftype=nofile bufhidden=hide nowrap"'

- It always reads the current directory; you can `lcd` if you want a different
  one:

      :Batchy tabnew | lcd /

  `:lcd` is like `:cd`, but only changes the directory for the current buffer.

If the current `filetype` is `batchy` then it will try to convert the buffer to
a shell script:

- Any arguments to `:Batchy` will be taken as the command to use; e.g. `:Batchy
  cp`, `:Batchy ln -s`. This defaults to `mv -n` if not given.
- Only lines matching `‚Üê` are processed.
- All other lines are commented out with `# `.

There is only exception to this: if the filetype is already `batchy` *and* the
buffer is empty, then it will re-use the current buffer.

Options
-------
`g:batchy_new` gets run just before batchy inserts anyway; you can put anything
in here, usually you want a command to open a new buffer: `new`, `vnew`,
`tabnew`, etc. The default value is:

    tabnew | setl noswapfile buftype=nofile bufhidden=hide nowrap

It highlights comments and the `d` to indicate directories with:

    hi batchy    guifg=#aaaaaa ctermfg=grey
    hi batchyDir guifg=#0000ff ctermfg=blue

Which you can change if you want.


Editing
-------
Some tips to edit filenames:

    :%s/^/prefix-/    add a prefix
    :%s/^prefix-//    remove a prefix

    :%s/ /-suffix/    add a suffix
    :%s/-suffix //    remove a suffix

    :%s/word/NEW/     replace word; because by default only the first match is
                      replaced this leaves the source filename alone.

This is why the source and destination are reversed: it's just so much easier.
If it would keep the `src dst` order all of the above would require a lot more
complex patterns.

*NOTE*: if you use `set gdefault` then you need to add a `/g` flag back, as
there is the assumption that only the first match will be replaced.

If you use spaces in your filename or want to be absolutely sure it will only
operate on the destination name, then you can use a more specific match:

    :%s/\ze *‚Üê/-suffix/     add a suffix
    :%s/-asd\ze *‚Üê//        remove a suffix

    :%s/word\ze.\{-}‚Üê/X/    replace word only in the "destination" column.

This matches "‚Üê preceeded by any space"; the `\ze` sets the "end of match"
location at the start, and whatever matches after that doesn't get replaced.

You can also use block visual mode (`<C-v>`), or any command really. Using `:g`
to filter out lines can also be useful:

    :g/foo/s!foo!bar!

If it turns out that you made a mistake after running `:Batchy` to generate a
shell script you can just use `u` to go back and try again.
